Instructions:
1. Write a detailed writing brief for Chapter 41.
2. Specify the POV Character and Voice.
3. Highlight any must-haves, such as tropes, key decisions, realizations, important exchanges or negotiations, and so on.
4. Only use characters and settings that have been previously established. Exception: stock characters or groups may be used if they only appear once, such as a waiter with no name or a crowd in the background that is making noise or stray comments.
5. Avoid using references to the sun, moon, or weather elements to suggest time. Instead refer to character action, or events in motion that take place within the immediate environment.
6. Climactic decisions are difficult due to the cost, so ensure that the rising action builds to a final difficult decision.
7. Provide enough detail to write a 5,000-word scene.8. Avoid clich√© scene exits such as opening a door to weather and describing an internal feeling. Instead, SHOW a decision being made, a decisive action taken, or an external interruption that represents a setback.
9. Tag output as [chapter 41 plan] Write the chapter plan here. [/chapter 41 plan].
