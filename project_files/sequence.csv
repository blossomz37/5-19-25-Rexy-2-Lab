5. Avoid using references to the sun, moon, or weather elements to suggest time. Instead refer to character action, or events in motion that take place within the immediate environment.

8. Avoid cliche scene exits such as opening a door to weather and describing an internal feeling. Instead, SHOW a decision being made, a decisive action taken, or an external interruption that represents a setback.
